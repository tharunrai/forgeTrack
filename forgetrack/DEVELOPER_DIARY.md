# ForgeTrack Developer Diary

## Past (What we've built)
- **Project Setup**: Initialized React + Vite application with Tailwind CSS.
- **Styling & Theme**: Implemented a modern, soft-modern SaaS aesthetic using Slate 900/800 void backgrounds, classic blue accent glows, and Plus Jakarta Sans typography. Custom CSS properties established in `src/index.css` and extended in `tailwind.config.js`.
- **Authentication**: 
  - Connected to Supabase for backend authentication.
  - Built `Login.jsx` handling role-based routing (mentor vs. student) with a hardcoded bypass for testing (`tharun@forge.local`).
  - Added `RoleGuard.jsx` to protect routes.
- **Layout**: Created a common `Shell.jsx` layout wrapper with a `Sidebar.jsx`.
- **Mentor Phase 1 & 2**:
  - `Dashboard.jsx`: Mentor dashboard showing session statistics, next upcoming session, and a list of tracked curriculum sessions fetched from Supabase.
  - `AttendanceMarking.jsx`: Interface for mentors to mark student attendance.
- **Mentor Phase 3**:
  - `StudentHistory.jsx`: Component displaying a searchable list of students, their branch, and calculated attendance percentages.
  - `Materials.jsx`: Resource sharing component serving both mentors (upload view) and students (read-only view) with fallback mock data handling.

## Present (Current State)
- The app supports a Mentor and Student flow. Mentor dashboard, attendance, student history, and materials sharing are now fully implemented.
- We have placeholder routes for Phase 4 and 5 (Upload CSV, My Attendance).
- API keys and DB connections are functional via `src/lib/supabase.js` and `src/lib/gemini.js`.

## Future (What's Next)
- **Phase 4**: CSV Upload feature for mentors.
- **Phase 5**: Student Dashboard (`MyAttendance`, `Upcoming Sessions`).
- **Refinement**: Adding AI insights using Gemini (integration started via `gemini.js` but needs features).
